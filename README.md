# Analysis of Complex Networks

## Homework 2

**Name**: Othmane Mahfoud
**Group**: Number 9

### Instructions

1. Please make sure you download the Group 9 data
2. Make sure you have the homework_2.ipynb file in the same directory as the folders Facebook-Ego and Twitter-Ego
3. Please run all the cells in homework_2.ipynb in order
4. In case the .ipynb file is corrupted you can find an updated version in the repository https://github.com/othmane-mahfoud/hw_2_complex_networks/tree/main

### Assumptions

1. The Description.txt files mention "The 'ego' node does not appear, but it is assumed that they follow every node id that appears in this file.". Based on your previous email however, I did not link the ego node to the other nodes in the edge file.
2. For question (c) in my case the graphs are not connected so not I compute the path length for the largest connected component in order to find the average path length.
